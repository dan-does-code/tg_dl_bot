Of course. "YOLO Mode" it is. Based on our initial discussion and your detailed plan, I've drafted the complete Project Brief. This document formalizes your vision and will serve as the foundation for the Product Manager and Architect.

# Project Brief: Telegram Video Downloader Bot

## Executive Summary

This project outlines the creation of a Telegram bot designed for downloading videos from various online platforms (starting with YouTube) by simply processing a shared link. The core problem this bot solves is twofold: for users, it provides a fast and convenient way to save videos; for the operator, it addresses the high operational costs of such a service. The key value proposition lies in an intelligent `file_id` caching strategy, which leverages Telegram's own infrastructure to serve popular videos instantly and at virtually no cost after the initial download, making the service highly efficient and scalable.

## Problem Statement

Users who wish to download videos from platforms like YouTube or TikTok often face inconvenient, ad-riddled, or potentially insecure third-party websites and apps. For developers attempting to solve this with a bot, the primary pain point is the significant and recurring cost of bandwidth and server resources. Each time a popular video is requested, it must be re-downloaded from the source and re-uploaded to Telegram, creating a slow user experience and an unsustainable cost model that scales linearly with usage.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a Python-based Telegram bot that acts as an intelligent orchestrator for the open-source download engine `yt-dlp`. The bot's key innovation is its caching mechanism.

*   **Path 1 (Cache Miss):** On receiving a new video link for the first time, the bot downloads the video, uploads it to the user, and critically, saves the returned Telegram `file_id` to a database, mapping it to the original URL. The local file is then deleted.
*   **Path 2 (Cache Hit):** For all subsequent requests for the same URL, the bot retrieves the `file_id` from its database and instructs Telegram to send the file directly. This bypasses any use of our server's resources, resulting in an instant and free delivery for the user and operator.

## Target Users

*   **Primary User Segment:** General Telegram users who want a quick, reliable way to save videos for offline viewing, sharing across platforms, or for archival purposes.
*   **Secondary User Segment:** Content creators and community managers who need to efficiently download videos for use in their own content or channels.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
*   Minimize operational costs to be sustainable on a free-tier hosting plan (e.g., Railway).
*   Achieve a high cache-hit ratio to validate the efficiency of the core architecture.
*   Build a functional MVP quickly to test the core hypothesis and gather user feedback.

### User Success Metrics
*   **Speed:** Cached video delivery should be near-instantaneous (< 2 seconds).
*   **Reliability:** A high percentage of valid, public video links should be processed successfully.
*   **Ease of Use:** The user interaction should be limited to simply sending a link.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*   **Cache Hit Rate:** (Number of Cache Hits / Total Requests). Target: > 80%.
*   **Monthly Active Users (MAU):** To measure adoption and growth.
*   **Average Response Time:** Measured separately for cache hits vs. misses to quantify performance gains.
*   **Download Success/Failure Rate:** To monitor the reliability of `yt-dlp`.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
*   Bot accepts and processes video links from a single platform: **YouTube**.
*   Full implementation of the `file_id` caching logic (both "Cache Miss" and "Cache Hit" paths).
*   A simple database (SQLite) for storing the URL-to-`file_id` mapping.
*   Graceful handling of successful downloads (sending the video file back to the user).
*   Basic error handling for failed downloads (e.g., "Sorry, I couldn't download this video.").

### Out of Scope for MVP
*   Support for other platforms (TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.).
*   A job queue system for handling concurrent downloads.
*   User-facing analytics or download history.
*   Format or quality selection (e.g., audio-only, 1080p vs 720p).
*   Support for downloading entire playlists or channels.

## Post-MVP Vision

*   **Phase 2:** Introduce support for a second high-demand platform (e.g., TikTok). Implement a job queue (e.g., Celery with Redis) to handle concurrent requests efficiently. Upgrade the database to PostgreSQL for better scalability.
*   **Long-term Vision:** Expand platform support, introduce features like format/quality selection, and potentially build a simple analytics dashboard to track popular videos and bot usage statistics.

## Technical Considerations

*   **Platform Requirements:** The bot must be deployable on a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) like Railway, operating within its free-tier limits for the MVP.
*   **Technology Preferences:**
    *   **Language:** Python
    *   **Telegram Bot Library:** `python-telegram-bot` or `aiogram`
    *   **Downloading Engine:** `yt-dlp` (as a Python library)
    *   **Database:** SQLite for MVP, with a clear path to migrate to PostgreSQL.
*   **Architecture Considerations:** The architecture is fundamentally cache-first. The MVP will be a single, monolithic process. Future versions will evolve into a multi-process architecture with a main bot process, a job queue, and one or more worker processes.

## Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**
    *   The project will initially be constrained by the resource limits of a free-tier hosting plan.
    *   The bot must operate within Telegram's API limits (e.g., file size limits, message rate limits).
    *   The bot's operation is dependent on the continued functionality of the `yt-dlp` project.
*   **Key Assumptions:**
    *   Telegram's `file_id` system will remain a stable, long-term feature.
    *   The cache hit rate will be high enough to make the service cost-effective.

## Risks & Open Questions

*   **Key Risks:**
    *   **Technical Risk:** `yt-dlp` may temporarily break when source websites update their structure. This requires a strategy for frequent updates.
    *   **Platform Risk:** The bot's functionality is against the Terms of Service of the source platforms.
    *   **Resource Risk:** A sudden influx of unique, "cache miss" requests could overwhelm the free-tier server resources.
*   **Open Questions:**
    *   What is the most efficient database schema for this task?
    *   What is the best strategy for updating the `yt-dlp` dependency with minimal downtime?
    *   How should the bot handle videos that exceed Telegram's file size limits?
