# Telegram Video Downloader Bot - Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
**IDE-based analysis with comprehensive existing documentation** - Document-project analysis appears to have been performed with excellent artifacts available at:
- `/docs/project-brief.md` - Comprehensive project vision and business context
- `/docs/architecture.md` - Detailed technical architecture and patterns
- `/docs/product-requirements.md` - Existing PRD for current functionality

### Current Project State
Your bot is a **working Telegram video downloader** with intelligent `file_id` caching strategy. Currently implementing:

- **Core Functionality**: YouTube video download via yt-dlp integration
- **Smart Caching**: URL → `file_id` mapping using SQLite database
- **Cache Strategy**: Cache Hit (instant delivery) vs Cache Miss (download → upload → cache)
- **Architecture**: Monolithic Python app using `python-telegram-bot` framework
- **Tech Stack**: Python 3.11+, SQLite, yt-dlp, deployed on Railway PaaS

**Current Behavior**: The bot downloads videos using yt-dlp's `'best[height<=720]'` format selector, which typically results in lower quality downloads (often below 720p, around 30-80MB for 10 minutes) to optimize for file size rather than quality.

### Available Documentation Analysis
**Using existing project analysis from document-project output.**

**Available Documentation:**
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (Complete in architecture.md)
- ✅ Source Tree/Architecture (Comprehensive)
- ✅ API Documentation (Telegram Bot API patterns documented)
- ✅ External API Documentation (yt-dlp integration patterns)
- ❌ UX/UI Guidelines (Telegram bot interactions only)
- ✅ Technical Debt Documentation (None identified - clean codebase)

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:**
- ✅ **New Feature Addition** (Quality/format selection UI)
- ✅ **Major Feature Modification** (Caching system overhaul)

**Enhancement Description:**
Transform the bot from automatic lowest-quality download to an interactive quality/format selection system. Users will receive clickable buttons showing available video qualities (240p, 380p, 480p, etc.) and audio-only options. Additionally, implement a flexible user settings system that allows configuring quality and file size constraints for optional quick download mode. The caching system must be enhanced to cache by URL + quality/format combination rather than just URL, ensuring cache hits only occur when users select the same quality for the same video.

**Impact Assessment:**
- ✅ **Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)**

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Enable user choice of video quality and format (video vs audio-only)
- Implement flexible user settings system with quality and file size constraints
- Maintain intelligent caching efficiency with granular cache keys (URL + quality + format)
- Preserve instant delivery experience for cached content
- Implement intuitive button-based selection and settings interface
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing cached content

**Background Context:**
The current implementation downloads videos at a dynamically selected quality level that prioritizes small file sizes over quality, which doesn't provide users with choice or flexibility. This enhancement addresses user demand for quality selection and personalized quick download settings while maintaining the cost-effective caching strategy that makes the service sustainable. The key architectural challenge is evolving from simple URL-based caching to compound cache keys that include quality and format preferences, ensuring the cache hit rate remains high while providing user choice and personalized automation.

## 2. Requirements

These requirements are based on my understanding of your existing system with the new interactive quality/format selection and flexible settings system. Please review carefully and confirm they align with your project's reality.

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The bot shall present users with available video quality options (240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, etc.) as clickable buttons when processing a video URL

**FR2**: The bot shall offer an audio-only download option alongside video quality choices

**FR3**: The caching system shall store files using compound keys (URL + quality + format) instead of URL-only keys

**FR4**: The bot shall provide a settings command that opens a button-based configuration interface

**FR5**: Users shall be able to set optional quality constraints (minimum quality, maximum quality) via button prompts

**FR6**: Users shall be able to set optional file size constraints (minimum MB, maximum MB) via button prompts  

**FR7**: The bot shall support quick download mode when user constraints are configured, automatically selecting the best match within constraints

**FR8**: When no available video quality meets user constraints, the bot shall present available options with constraint mismatch explanation

**FR9**: The bot shall validate constraint logic (ensuring minimum <= maximum for both quality and file size)

**FR10**: Existing cached content shall remain accessible and be migrated to the new caching schema

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Enhancement must maintain existing cache hit performance for identical URL + quality + format combinations

**NFR2**: Settings configuration interface must respond within 2 seconds for button interactions

**NFR3**: Quality detection and button generation must complete within 5 seconds for any supported video URL

**NFR4**: Database schema migration must preserve all existing cached file_ids without data loss

**NFR5**: Memory usage during quality detection must not exceed current baseline by more than 30%

- **Settings Configuration Screen**: Current settings display with individual constraint buttons
- **Constraint Input Prompts**: Individual prompts for quality (e.g., "Enter minimum quality: 480") and file size (e.g., "Enter maximum MB: 100")
- **Settings Overview Screen**: Summary of all active constraints with edit/clear options

**Modified Existing Screens:**
- **Help Command**: Updated to include quality selection and settings information
- **Stats Command**: Enhanced to show cache statistics by quality/format breakdown
- **Processing Messages**: Updated to indicate quality detection and user selection phases

### UI Consistency Requirements

**Button Layout Standards:**
- Maximum 3 buttons per row for quality selection to ensure mobile compatibility
- Consistent emoji usage (🎥 for video qualities, 🎵 for audio, ⚙️ for settings)
- Clear labeling with both resolution and approximate file size estimates where possible

**Interaction Flow Consistency:**
- All multi-step interactions must provide "◀️ Back" and "❌ Cancel" options
- Settings changes require confirmation before applying
- Error messages must include actionable next steps
- Progress indicators during quality detection phase

**Message Formatting Standards:**
- Maintain existing markdown formatting for consistency
- Use consistent emoji patterns for different message types
- Preserve current caption format for delivered videos with quality information

## 4. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.11+

- Gradual migration approach with fallback to existing cache entries
- Resource monitoring and optimization for Railway constraints
- Comprehensive error handling for all new interaction flows

## 5. Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

Based on my analysis of your existing project, I believe this enhancement should be structured as **a single comprehensive epic** because:

1. **Cohesive Feature Set**: Quality selection, settings management, and enhanced caching are tightly integrated components that work together as one user-facing feature
2. **Shared Dependencies**: All components depend on the same database schema changes and yt-dlp integration enhancements
3. **Atomic Deployment**: The feature delivers maximum value when all components are available together
4. **Existing Architecture**: Your current monolithic structure supports incremental enhancement within a single epic better than splitting across multiple epics

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with incremental, risk-minimized story sequence that maintains existing system integrity while building new functionality progressively.

## 6. Epic 1: Interactive Quality & Format Selection with User Settings

**Epic Goal**: Transform the bot from automatic quality download to an interactive system where users can select video quality/format preferences through an intuitive button interface, with optional personalized settings for quick download mode, while maintaining the efficient caching architecture and existing system performance.

**Integration Requirements**: All new functionality must integrate seamlessly with existing cache hit/miss logic, preserve current command structure, and maintain Railway free-tier resource constraints.
