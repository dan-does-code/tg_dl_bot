# Story 1.3: Interactive Quality Selection Interface

## Story
As a **bot user**,
I want **to see available video qualities as clickable buttons and select my preferred option**,
so that **I can choose the quality that best fits my needs and bandwidth**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Bot presents available qualities as inline keyboard buttons (240p, 360p, 480p, etc.)
2. Audio-only option is clearly labeled and available when supported
3. Buttons include quality resolution and approximate file size information
4. User selection triggers download of specifically chosen quality/format
5. Selection interface includes cancel option to abort download

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing automatic download can be bypassed cleanly without system errors
- IV2: Current message handling architecture supports new interactive patterns
- IV3: Button interface works consistently across different Telegram clients

## Dev Notes

### Current Bot Implementation Analysis
From `bot.py:79-92`, current message handling:
```python
async def handle_message(self, update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    """Handle text messages (potential video URLs)"""
    message_text = update.message.text.strip()
    
    # Check if message contains a video URL
    if not self.is_video_url(message_text):
        await update.message.reply_text(
            "Please send me a valid YouTube video URL.\n"
            "Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
        )
        return
        
    # Process the video URL
    await self.process_video_url(update, message_text)
```

### Interactive Interface Requirements
- Replace direct `process_video_url` call with format detection
- Present quality options as InlineKeyboardMarkup buttons
- Handle callback queries for user selections
- Maintain state between format detection and download
- Add cancel/back navigation options

### Button Layout Strategy
- Maximum 3 buttons per row for mobile compatibility
- Video qualities sorted highest to lowest (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, 240p)
- Audio-only option clearly distinguished with ðŸŽµ emoji
- File size estimates shown in button text when available
- Cancel button always available

## Tasks

### Task 1: Implement Format Detection Integration
- [x] Modify `handle_message` to detect formats before presenting options
- [x] Add format detection error handling and fallback to direct download
- [x] Implement progress messages during format detection
- [x] Handle cases where no formats are available

### Task 2: Create Quality Selection Interface
- [x] Design and implement `create_quality_selection_keyboard()` method
- [x] Format button text with quality and file size information  
- [x] Implement proper button layout (max 2 per row for mobile compatibility)
- [x] Add audio-only option with clear labeling
- [x] Include cancel option in interface

### Task 3: Implement Callback Query Handling
- [x] Add callback query handler to bot setup
- [x] Parse callback data to extract format selection
- [x] Implement download execution based on user selection
- [x] Add proper error handling for invalid selections
- [x] Handle cancel/abort operations

### Task 4: State Management and User Experience
- [x] Implement temporary state storage for format data
- [x] Add loading/progress indicators during operations
- [x] Handle concurrent users and session management
- [x] Add timeout handling for abandoned selections
- [x] Ensure clean error recovery and user feedback

## Testing
- Manual testing with various video URLs
- Button layout testing across different qualities available
- Callback query handling testing
- Error scenario testing (invalid URLs, network issues)
- Multi-user concurrent testing

### Completion Notes
- Successfully implemented comprehensive interactive quality selection interface using Telegram inline keyboards
- Bot now presents available video qualities (240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, etc.) as clickable buttons with file size information
- Audio-only download option clearly labeled and integrated
- Callback query system handles user selections with proper URL parsing (fixed colon-parsing issue)
- Format detection integrated with fallback to direct download if detection fails
- Enhanced caching now uses compound keys (URL + quality + format type) for precise cache matching
- All interactive interface tests pass, including button layout, callback parsing, and state management
- Fixed Unicode encoding issues for Windows console display during testing

### File List
**Modified:**
- `bot.py` - Enhanced TelegramVideoBot with complete interactive interface
  - Added `handle_video_url_with_selection()` method for format detection
  - Added `create_quality_selection_keyboard()` method for button generation
  - Added comprehensive callback query handling with URL parsing fixes
  - Added `download_cached_version()` and `download_selected_format()` methods
  - Enhanced error handling and user feedback messages

**Created:**
- `test_interactive_interface.py` - Comprehensive test suite for interactive components
