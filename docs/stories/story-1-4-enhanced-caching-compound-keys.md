# Story 1.4: Enhanced Caching with Compound Keys

## Story
As a **system**,
I want **to cache videos using compound keys (URL + quality + format) instead of URL-only keys**,
so that **different quality/format combinations of the same video can be cached and served independently**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Videos are cached using compound keys (URL + quality + format)
2. Cache lookup checks for exact quality/format matches before downloading
3. Cache hit delivers previously cached content instantly for matching requests
4. Cache miss downloads and stores new quality/format combinations
5. Cache statistics track hit rates across different quality/format combinations

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing cache hit performance is maintained for identical URL + quality + format combinations
- IV2: Multiple quality/format combinations of same video can coexist in cache
- IV3: Cache storage and retrieval works seamlessly with interactive quality selection

## Dev Notes

### Current Caching Analysis
The database schema was enhanced in Story 1.1 to support compound keys, but the actual cache hit optimization in the quality selection flow was missing.

### Enhanced Caching Implementation
- Database already supports compound key storage via `store_cached_file_id_compound()`
- Database already supports compound key retrieval via `get_cached_file_id_compound()`
- Missing piece: Cache hit check in `download_selected_format()` method before downloading

### Cache Hit Optimization Strategy
1. **Before Download**: Check `get_cached_file_id_compound(url, quality, format_type)`
2. **Cache Hit Path**: Send cached file_id directly to user (instant delivery)
3. **Cache Miss Path**: Download, upload, store with compound key
4. **Logging**: Track compound key cache hits vs misses

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add Cache Hit Check to Quality Selection Flow
- [x] Modify `download_selected_format()` to check cache before downloading
- [x] Implement instant delivery for cache hits with compound keys
- [x] Add proper error handling and fallback for failed cached deliveries
- [x] Add logging for compound key cache hit tracking

### Task 2: Testing and Validation
- [x] Test compound key storage and retrieval functionality
- [x] Test cache hit vs miss scenarios with various combinations
- [x] Test cache statistics with multiple quality/format combinations
- [x] Verify backward compatibility with existing cache entries

## Testing
- Compound key storage and retrieval testing
- Cache hit vs miss scenario validation
- Enhanced cache statistics verification
- Backward compatibility testing with old cache entries

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- Claude Sonnet 4

### Debug Log References
- None yet

### Completion Notes
- Successfully completed the missing cache hit optimization in interactive quality selection flow
- Cache hit check now works before downloading, providing instant delivery for exact URL + quality + format matches
- Compound key caching system is now fully functional end-to-end
- Database infrastructure was already complete from Story 1.1, only needed the retrieval optimization
- All compound key functionality tested and working: storage, retrieval, statistics, backward compatibility
- Cache hit performance optimized for quality selection workflow
- Logging added to track compound key cache hits vs misses for monitoring

### File List
**Modified:**
- `bot.py` - Enhanced `download_selected_format()` method with compound key cache hit check
  - Added cache lookup before downloading using `get_cached_file_id_compound()`
  - Added instant delivery path for cache hits (both video and audio)
  - Added proper error handling and fallback for failed cached deliveries
  - Added logging for compound key cache hit tracking
  - Maintained existing cache miss path with compound key storage

**Created:**
- `test_compound_key_caching.py` - Comprehensive test suite for compound key functionality
