# Story 1.6: Quick Download Mode with Constraint Matching

## Story
As a **bot user with configured settings**,
I want **the bot to automatically download videos matching my constraints without showing selection buttons**,
so that **I can enjoy fast downloads while maintaining control over quality preferences**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Bot checks user settings before presenting quality selection interface
2. When constraints are set, bot automatically selects best matching quality/format
3. Constraint matching handles edge cases (no matches, multiple matches)
4. Users receive clear feedback when constraints cannot be satisfied
5. Quick mode can be disabled to return to interactive selection

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing auto-download performance is maintained or improved in quick mode
- IV2: Current cache hit/miss logic works seamlessly with constraint-based selection
- IV3: Constraint validation doesn't introduce delays in existing workflows

## Dev Notes

### Current Download Flow Analysis
From `bot.py:95-97`, current video handling:
```python
# Process the video URL with quality selection
await self.handle_video_url_with_selection(update, message_text)
```

### Quick Mode Requirements
- Check user settings before showing quality selection interface
- If quick_mode_enabled=True and constraints exist, automatically select best match
- Implement constraint matching algorithm for quality and file size
- Provide fallback to interactive mode when no constraints match
- Maintain existing cache hit optimization
- Clear user feedback for constraint matching results

### Constraint Matching Algorithm
1. **Quality Matching**: Filter available formats by min/max quality constraints
2. **File Size Matching**: Filter remaining formats by min/max file size constraints  
3. **Best Match Selection**: Choose highest quality within constraints
4. **Fallback Handling**: Show interactive selection if no matches or quick mode disabled

### User Experience Flow
```
User sends video URL
↓
Check user settings
↓
Quick mode enabled? → No → Show interactive selection (existing flow)
↓ Yes  
Constraints configured? → No → Show interactive selection
↓ Yes
Detect available formats
↓
Apply constraint filters
↓
Matches found? → No → Show interactive selection with constraint message
↓ Yes
Auto-select best match → Download directly
```

## Tasks

### Task 1: Implement Constraint Matching Logic
- [x] Create format filtering by quality constraints
- [x] Create format filtering by file size constraints
- [x] Implement best match selection algorithm
- [x] Add constraint matching validation and testing

### Task 2: Integrate Quick Mode with Download Flow
- [x] Modify video URL handler to check user settings first
- [x] Implement auto-selection when constraints match
- [x] Add fallback to interactive mode for edge cases
- [x] Maintain existing cache hit optimization

### Task 3: User Feedback and Error Handling
- [x] Add clear messaging for constraint matching results
- [x] Implement fallback messages when no formats match constraints
- [x] Add option to temporarily override quick mode
- [x] Ensure smooth user experience transitions

### Task 4: Testing and Optimization
- [x] Test constraint matching with various video formats
- [x] Verify performance impact is minimal
- [x] Test edge cases (no matches, single match, multiple matches)
- [x] Validate cache hit/miss logic preservation

## Testing
- Quick mode activation with various constraint combinations
- Constraint matching algorithm testing
- Edge case handling (no matches, extreme constraints)
- Performance testing (quick mode vs interactive mode)
- Cache integration testing

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- Claude Sonnet 4

### Debug Log References
- None yet

### Completion Notes
- Successfully implemented complete quick download mode functionality with constraint matching
- Users can now configure quality and file size constraints that automatically select best matching formats
- Quick mode integrates seamlessly with existing interactive quality selection (fallback when no matches)
- Comprehensive constraint matching algorithm handles quality ranges, file size limits, and format preferences
- Cache integration works perfectly - quick mode checks compound key cache before downloading
- Smart fallback logic: video preferred over audio, interactive mode when no constraints match
- All user experience flows tested: new users, configured users, disabled mode, constraint changes
- Edge cases handled: impossible constraints, audio fallback, no matches, multiple matches
- Performance optimized: quick mode adds minimal overhead and maintains cache hit performance

### File List
**Modified:**
- `bot.py` - Added complete quick mode implementation to video handling flow
  - Added quick mode activation check in `handle_video_url_with_selection()`
  - Added `_has_constraints()` helper method
  - Added `_find_best_matching_format()` for constraint matching
  - Added `_quality_matches_constraints()` for video quality filtering
  - Added `_file_size_matches_constraints()` for file size filtering
  - Added `_select_highest_quality_video()` for best video selection
  - Added `_download_quick_mode_selection()` for automatic downloads
  - Integrated with compound key caching system
  - Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback

**Created:**
- `test_quick_mode.py` - Constraint matching logic test suite
- `test_quick_mode_integration.py` - End-to-end integration test suite
